# Git Diff Review

Review the current git diff in the miniclaw repo, summarise what has changed, and suggest how to group the changes into commits.

## Step 1: Announce repo

Start your response by stating the absolute path of the git repo root (run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`).

## Step 2: Gather state

Run these commands from the repo root:

1. `git status` — to see all modified, staged, and untracked files
2. `git diff` — to see unstaged changes
3. `git diff --staged` — to see any already-staged changes
4. `git log --oneline -5` — to see recent commit style

## Step 3: Analyse and report

For each changed file, briefly describe what changed and why.

## Step 4: Suggest commits

Group related changes into logical commits. For each suggested commit:

- List the files to include
- Suggest a commit message following the repo's conventional commit style (e.g. `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:`)

If the working tree is clean, just say so.

## Step 5: Ask to proceed

Ask the user if they want you to commit and push, or if they want to adjust the grouping.
