# Register Telegram Bot Commands

Read all available skills and register them as Telegram bot commands via the `setMyCommands` API. This is idempotent — running it multiple times just overwrites the command list.

## Step 1: Discover skills

List all skill directories:

```bash
ls -1 ../.claude/skills/
```

For each directory found, read its `SKILL.md` file using the Read tool. Extract the `name` and `description` fields from the YAML frontmatter.

## Step 2: Build the command list

Combine the discovered skills with these hardcoded commands that don't have SKILL.md files:

- `chatid` — "Get your Telegram chat ID"
- `cancel` — "Cancel the current request"
- `compact` — "Compact conversation context to free up space"

Telegram command descriptions have a 256-character limit. Truncate any descriptions that exceed this.

## Step 3: Register commands

Build a JSON array of `{"command": "name", "description": "desc"}` objects and call the Telegram API:

```bash
curl -s https://api.telegram.org/bot$TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN/setMyCommands \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"commands": [...]}'
```

The response should contain `{"ok": true}`. If it doesn't, report the error.

## Step 4: Report

List all registered commands with their descriptions and confirm success.
